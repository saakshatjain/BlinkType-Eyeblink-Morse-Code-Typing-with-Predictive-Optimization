# BlinkType: Eyeblink Morse Code Typing with Predictive Optimization

## Overview
BlinkType is an innovative typing interface that leverages eyeblink detection to input text using Morse code. This project combines real-time signal processing with a predictive text system to optimize the typing experience by suggesting words based on partial input.

## Features
- **Eyeblink-Based Input**: Converts blink patterns into Morse code for text entry.
- **Morse Code Interpreter**: Decodes the sequences of short and long blinks into alphanumeric characters.
- **Predictive Text Optimization**: Utilizes a tokenizer and model to suggest words and speed up typing.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Employs a TFLite model for rapid inference on various devices.
